rcorder(8) with concurrent rc-script execution
==============================================

Testing
=======
If you build rcorder with -DDEBUG (default), you can test that it works
correctly by running rcorder with the -d flag (it will not actually execute
any rc scripts with -d):

./rcorder -d -T ./rc.trampoline -r -s nostart /etc/rc.d/* /usr/local/etc/rc.d/*

Install
=======
1. Build this rcorder
2. Make sure it works (see Testing)
3. install new manpage (optional)
4. cp rc.trampoline /etc/rc.trampoline
5. chmod 555 /etc/rc.trampoline
6. Install rcorder to /sbin
7. Patch /etc/rc

The rc.diff patch will use concurrent mode only for scripts after the
$early_late_divider and fall back to the traditional method in case of
errors.

Additionally, you can apply rc_early_late.diff which will use the concurrent
mode for the scripts before the $early_late_divider, too (this method might
be a bit faster):
